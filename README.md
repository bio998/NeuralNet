# NeuralNet
A reinforcement learning neural network built in Unity.

This repository contains the Assets folder for Unity (version 5.6.1f1).

It contains clear code for the neural network, a genetic evolutionary training algorith, and for saving and loading trained sets of parameters for the neural net.

I coded everything here from scratch, including the neural net, mutation and recombination evolutionary algorithms.  I got some inspiration from this video:

especially useful was the analysis of the different types of genetic recombination and mutation criteria.

Feel free to use my code, but consider it a collaboration.
